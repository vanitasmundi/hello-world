# hello-world

Hello peeps! 

It's me Ines. I hope you're having an amazing evening and enjoying your life.
Because I am not:)
I love anything that involves music. I also adore watching films. If you've never seen 'Spirited Away' or 'V for Vendetta' then you're missing out!

Thank you for reading this:)
I wish you all the best
Greetings
